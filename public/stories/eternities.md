synopsis: The afterlife of a mass-murderer, as narrated by Death..
---

For my whole stay here in the world of humans, I witnessed several men who cultivated a hostile obsession with my power. Men who had given me a thousand souls in the span of several years. But among these spectacular men, only one man has convinced millions of people to side with me. Only one man has brought up an army and an ideology — or more aptly, a religion — in which I am proclaimed as God. "The big unifier," they deeemed me. Deathism. I have never felt this kind of overwhelming intensity before. The genocides of the past were the best of times, indeed, but a time where a religion that worshipped my power existed? I feel indestructible. I feel all-powerful. The times are changing.

This man, whom I shall simply call "The President," the leader of a nation, was obsessed with me. With regards to his own impending demise, death was something he accepted ever since his power was bestowed on him after the elections, by the majority vote. As for inflicting death on others, he was obsessed with my power. When his authority was granted by the nation, he immediately signed the bill for capital punishment, encompassing all kinds of crimes — from cold-blooded murder, to piracy, to plagiarism. Judges and lawyers lost their occupations, while the police force subsequently increased in number exponentially. My _raison d'être_ has never been more difficult and more fulfilling: I was taking souls left and right, back and forth in time. I am exhausted, but I am enraptured.

Over a few years, my energy and willpower to take souls with no ounce of rest had waned. My enthusiasm dwindled, diminished. The rejoicing fanatics of Deathism were always a pleasure to hear from, but I badly wanted something new. I wanted _rest_, but my definition of rest constitutes as something else with relation to my power, and not dozing off and relaxation, like mere mortals do. I abhor laziness. I cherish overwork death.

One rainy night, while harvesting piles of cadavers on a dark, puddled alleway at the heart of the slums, it dawned on me. _Eureka! I have a plan!_ I finally decided on what kind of change I want to take. I gave it a thought, weighing the pros and cons, and made up my mind: I am going to exert my power over The President himself. I am going to end his life. I shall give him an inkling of what death, at its very essence, is like; the one thing he vehemently obsesses about. He shall awaken as his own ghost, with no knowledge of his own death, no awareness that I have already claimed his soul.

Eventually, without his supreme command, this endless genocide perpetrated by his police force shall come to an immediate halt.

This should be very, very interesting. I cannot wait!

### ⁂

It was a long and busy day and night for The President, as most of his days were. It was four in the morning when he finished his final press conference for the day. For someone his age, he was astonishingly healthy, having little to no slumber. Nevertheless, my plan shall take effect today. There are no exceptions and turnarounds to it. The termination of life, no matter how rough or smooth its course, was something that cannot be stopped and prevented. Reincarnation and immortality would render my power useless, but that is not how the laws were written. Those things simply do not exist.

Several hours later, at eight o'clock, perfectly on schedule, The President awakens. He retains his earthly form, now as the spectre of his dead self. As expected, he starts with his solitary morning routine of washing his face in front of the mirror, taking a careful look in his aged features, praying on his personal altar, and getting dressed in an embroided attire which he will be wearing for the rest of the day.

The President's personal guardian was always the first and last person to see him outside his quarters, before he rests and after he prepares for the day, a relatively middle-aged soldier sworn to protect him to the death, forbidding anyone from passing through. As the president turns the knob and exits through the hallway, the guardian did not welcome him with a formal salutation and instead keeps on his position perfectly still and straight, eyes unwavering. He gave his guardian an attentive glance, but his presence was ignored. "Good morning," the President finally said as he continued to shuffle down the corridor. There was no response, but it is well known he does not take offence on such little matters.

As he made rounds at the presidential mansion, the chambermaids and manservants also appear to be completely oblivious to his presence. He keenly observed their movements; they were a bit more lax and carefree than when he was around, more than what he routinely sees, indicating that no one really sees, or _feels_, him. Having caught off guard by the odd encounter, speculating whether they were deliberately turning a blind eye to him, he hurriedly strode back to his resting quarters, the guardian ignoring him once again.

This was the time I uncloaked and revealed myself to him, standing on the opposite corner of his room. I borrowed the form of an ordinary human. He initially thought he was hallucinating from a side effect of a psychotropic drug he was periodically taking. He disregarded my appearance and darted toward the lavatory. The President rinsed his eyes and stared across the mirror with his hands grasping the porcelain sink. "I am going mad," I heard him muse to himself. The thoughts of a dead person become loud and audible to me once they cross the realm.

I waited for the President to come out. As he returned to his room, it did not take long for him to affirm my presence. "Who the hell are you? How did you get in here?"

"How are you feeling today? Seeing a lot of odd things, I presume?"

"What have you done to them?"

"Oh, nothing is wrong… Nothing, I can assure you. Your people are doing quite well. You, on the other hand…" I did not saying anything after, waiting for him to be conscious about his… situation. "Who do you imagine I am?"

"…No."

"Yes. You are correct."

This is how people reacted upon realising their own death: trembling, tongue-tied, despairing. The President was not an exception. I can hear his dead heart pounding. I can taste the hollow emptiness that slowly consumed whatever was left on his being. It was always a sight to behold, and only I had the honour to witness this turning point in every soul. To me, it was as beautiful as the metamorphosis of a larvae to a chrysalis to a butterfly. "It was only a matter of time, was it not?" He finally spoke with a tone that did not sound like a question.

"I chose this."

"Is this what happens to every dead person? I must be a special case."

"Yes, you _are_ special. Not only have you produced a thousand souls for me — and I extend my deepest gratitude to you for that, for the things only men born of courage can commit — but you are also responsible for the cult that glorifies my name and power, and I shall tell you this: not a single soul ever since the universe was young has done the same thing."

"I am not as magnificent as you think."

"I did not say that, no. You are demon-incarnate, and there is nothing magnificent about that. The appropriate M word would be _morbid_; you have a morbid knack for the macabre. You had your followers believe that your grand design — your declaration of war against criminals — was all for retribution, but in actuality the sight and stench of blood excites your core. You are the single greatest mass murderer for your draconian ways, a far more intelligent and more successful Charles Manson, that even the angels of God are terrified of your insidious psychopathy."

"That's quite the speech. I don't deny it, however, now that I'm dead for good. I am the only true extinctionist I know," the President openly divulged. "I wonder what my funeral will be like. I now have the privilege to see it for myself, I suppose."

"What do you think your funeral will be like?"

"Everyone will mourn my loss. To them, I am hope. A hero of the oppressed. That will be my legacy. All because of a bloodlust I learned to control. Isn't that funny?"

I agreed. "Such is the way of things. The universe designed everything to be funny."

The President snickered. "It doesn't seem so bad. Here, I mean."

"Liking your stay here in the Otherworld, so far?"

"Is that the name for it?"

"Names are just names. Shouldn't you, of all souls, know that, given how you treat your victims as nameless piles of corpses? Who cares about names?"

"Right." The President took a few steps and sat on the edge of his bed. "So what's going to happen now? There is consciousness after death, after all. Surely all of those fables about eternal hellfire, judgement day, are true?"

"Is that what you expect? Little demons cooking you in a giant cauldron for the rest of eternity?"

"God made me this way for a reason. I have always been agnostic about his judgement. I believe it's a lot more complex than choosing between good and evil. If I am to be judged for my ends, I must be the greatest man to ever live, for I have successfully eradicated evil from the face of the earth. The demons must be mad at me for losing their jobs."

"Well," I paused before continuing, "This is your eternity, _your_ hereafter. Just an endless, isolated stroll in the world. You can see everyone and everything that happens henceforth, but nobody can see you. I have not given you the powers of a poltergeist, either. You are dead and powerless."

"Can I at least have a smoke?"

The President produced a premium cigar from his coat pocket and lit a fire. "Will I see my parents?"

"No."

He let out an expletive. "Where are they, if I am here?"

"In their own Eternities."

"To be born is a curse," he muttered.

"Not exactly. Your earthly actions dictate your Otherworldly Eternity. I am forbidden to tell what specific people's Eternities are like. However, I can give you a rough idea."

"Take all the time you need. I have a whole eternity to listen."

I laughed off his dry humour. "Life after death is called an Eternity: a continuous, infinite projection of a dead person's mind. Every dead person has an Eternity, and they are all arbitrary, depending on how they lived their lives. Kindhearted people are rewarded with an Eternity that corresponds to what their hearts desire the most — I would like to point out that most humans are rarely ambitious; their largest desire is often quality time with their families. Some cases exist where a person's heart desires something else. You understand the gist. If you will believe, I am quite generous with good Eternities. However, there also are bad eggs in the basket, spoiled mushrooms in the garden. They have less appealing Eternities."

"I must be a rotten egg then."

"I want to see how you would cope with the Eternity I designed for you. I do not talk to dead people and tell them these things. You are an exception. I wanted to put an ironic emphasis on your obsession with me and my power. You will see all your loved ones grow old and die. You will see a lot of people die."

### ⁂

I went back seventy-seven years later, about his age when I gave him death. I saw his spectre, smoking the same, unending premium cigar he had the first time we met, sitting on one of the benches near the hilltop at a remote, rural town. His eyes were tired and emotionless, desolate. "We meet again," I greeted him.

He did not speak.

"Taking it well, so far?"

"'So far'…" he finally spoke. "An expression mainly used during an early point in time, when struggling on something difficult. The way you say it makes me feel like the near century I have spent as a dead person is only the beginning. It's funny." Not having spoken to a single soul except for me during that span of seventy-seven years, his choice of words and language remained the same.

"What is?"

"When you have all the time and energy, when you know for sure you are here for eternity, the world feels small. I mean that literally. I know every corner of this world. Nothing feels new anymore. Not even death. I wish you gave me the power to sleep. I feel like I've lived a thousand years. Do you think you can allow me to sleep?"

"No."

"Well then, I have no interest in talking to you."

### ⁂

I came back two centuries later. Three hundred years since the President's death.

"Does it ever get tiring for you? Reaping souls since the beginning of time?"

"There is only one time where I truly felt tired. That was during your term, when the killings were so rampant that it almost curbed your population."

He gave his premium cigar a long, powerful puff. We were walking in the heart of the metropolis. "To them," pointing his lit premium cigar to the crowd, "I am nothing but an engraving in some dead artist's painting. A lesson in one chapter of their history books. Isn't that just sad? I have been dead longer than I have been alive, yet I find myself attached to this material world. I always keep an eye on my dwindling significance and legacy in history. A few more centuries, and no one — spare a few hardcore historians — would even know my name. Yet Jesus is still omnipresent. A fictitious figure, still popular as ever. I wish I knew his secret."

### ⁂

I returned a millennium since his death. He was no longer speaking to me, no matter what I say. He was hollow inside and out, down to his bones. There was no soul left on his spectre. He was an empty vessel with no vestige of humanity left. I decided that it was time. I did not have the heart to inflict a punishment this harsh and painful and severe. An Eternity of isolation, desolation, and powerless solitude. No man deserves this kind of torment, no matter what grave sins he had committed during his fleeting years on Earth. It was nothing compared to this. And so, I rotated my scythe and raised its other end — a secondary scythe far sharper and shorter than my first scythe, which would bring an end to one's Eternity — and hacked his soul with a strong surge and pressure over its force, putting an end to the infinite misery that lies and runs deep inside his empty soul. His spectre disintegrated back into the universe, and he was gone forever, to eternal slumber.
